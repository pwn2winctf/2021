## FAQ

We are using a simplified version of [NIZKCTF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05844.pdf) this time. Our new platform is still secure and opensource, but does not need a GitHub account anymore.

**Registration:**

One account per team. If you want to receive job offers and invitations to sponsor's private bug bounty programs, mark the checkbox when registering your team.

**Source:**

You can find the source code for the Frontend [here](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/nizkctf-front), and for the Backend [here](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/nizkctf-v2/tree/development).

**Open audit:**

Flag submissions are completely transparent and subject to open audit. If you want to audit the scoreboard, take a look at the tool provided by [nizkctf-admin-toolkit](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/nizkctf-admin-toolkit). During the competition, a signed and timestamped copy of the audit trail will also be recorded [here](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/nizkctf-audit-trail), together with a scoreboard validated against it.

**Cache:**

Maybe you need to wait some seconds to see your score in the scoreboard.
