Shortly after Laura managed to reverse engineer the first version of the access control system, the government lab released a second version! The requirements document now contains the following specification: "the bitfile should work correctly only when programmed to official government boards".

Laura recalled the report of a similar mechanism described in the time capsule files. In 2018, Brazil, the country to which the island belonged, implemented a similar mechanism in the DREs they used to elect their politicians.

Knowing the [Rhiza test infrastructure](https://fpga.pwn2.win) programs the bitfile provided by the user to an official government board, find out which access code is accepted by this new version of the bitfile.

**Note**: You still need to reverse engineer the bitfile. But now, besides that, you also need to interact with the test infrastructure.

**Important**: The switch port to which the board is connected is filtered. Only packets coming from the 200.18.104.100 address are able to reach the internet.
