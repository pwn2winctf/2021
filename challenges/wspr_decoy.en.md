In the years leading up to the war, radio amateurs built extraordinarily reliable and durable beacon transmitters. These transmitters can still be heard today on the radio waves that reach Rhiza and are even documented in high school textbooks!

Studying the files contained in the time capsule placed on the island by Telefonica and other companies in the 2020s, Laura recently came across a somewhat curious implementation of a WSPR transmitter.

This transmitter inserts a secondary modulation over WSPR, almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The call sign of the code's author corresponds precisely to one of the beacon stations that can be heard till today. This station is in the area where the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos was once located.

Can these transmitters reveal something that is not told by official government accounts? Perhaps they are linked to some resistance movement by the people overseas!

Unfortunately, the time capsule contains only the encoder's source code. Can you implement the corresponding decoder? Record the beacons transmitted every 10 min and feed them to your decoder, retrieving the contents of the transmitter's `flag.txt` file.

**Important note to 2021 competitors**

Use to your advantage that the planet has not yet been devastated! There are many public KiwiSDR, OpenWebRX and WebSDR receivers on the internet. Use these receivers to record the audio from the transmitter. You can also look at the [WSPRNet history](https://wsprnet.org/olddb?mode=html&band=all&limit=10000&findcall=PU2UID&findreporter=&sort=date) to observe which regions of the planet are receiving the signal at any given time. Schedule future recordings based on the knowledge of which areas usually receive the beacons at a particular time of the day.

We recommend that you record, as soon as possible, **at least** 4 broadcasts of the signal with a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and without significant fading. Start recording the broadcasts even before implementing your decoder.
