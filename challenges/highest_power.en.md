Laura is very curious and ended up discovering that the leaders of the city-state of Rhiza share a secret. This secret is only revealed when they are all gathered. Due to the carelessness of one of them, Laura was able to intercept the message with the program to be used at the time of the disclosure and extract it. But, despite all her efforts, Laura was unable to reveal the shared secret. Therefore, she needs help to understand how the program works and finally find out what this secret is!
