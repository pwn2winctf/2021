Government of Rhiza has been creating some tools to make the slave labor more efficient. Laura scanned all IPs addresses from Rhiza's ASN and found one of these tools. Your goal is to get into the server to be able to collect the IP addresses that connects to it. Once collected, we can find out the approximate location of these machines.
