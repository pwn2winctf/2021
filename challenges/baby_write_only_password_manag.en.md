It looks like the leaders of the city-state of Rhiza are using an odd password manager. Laura got access to the machine but hasn't been able to extract the password yet. After running *cpuid*, maybe you're able to *speculate* what the secret is. Obs: There is no need to escalate your privilege. The binary *server* should be running on the machine (check it with ps).
