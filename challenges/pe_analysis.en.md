While searching for more information hidden by the government, Laura intercepted communication between a member of the Development team and a member of the Operation team. In summary, meeting the demand of the Security team, a Web application was developed to provide a program used for the analysis of PE binaries. Laura found the files used on that Web application and was able to reproduce its environment using VMware as virtualizer. She suspects that the program may be vulnerable, but she doesn't master binary exploitation. Therefore, she needs your help exploiting it.
