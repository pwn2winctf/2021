A computer manufactured in the 1980s is on display in the Rhiza museum. That computer is never turned off and is kept running some MS-DOS software. It is said to contain one of the first advanced AI algorithms produced by mankind, which was programmed to answer the problem of faster-than-light space travel. The government keeps the computer running in the hope that someday the program will complete and show the result of its execution. Colonization of other planets would be the only means for humanity to expand again now that, according to the government, humans can't inhabit large regions outside Rhiza.

Laura knows that this is obviously nonsense. She suspects the program does something very straightforward, but that could not be implemented efficiently with the computers at the time. Are you able to unveil what this program is computing? Can you get the answer the program would show on screen, but much faster than it does?
