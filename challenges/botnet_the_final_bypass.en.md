rafael\_p (aka rafaeleeto) works as Principal Hacker Engineer in a topsecret hacking division of the Government of Rhiza, called HARPA (Highly Advanced Research Projects Agency). Laura got access to a Botnet Project he is working on, called "Butcher Network". It is a "Bot Manager", a new concept in the context of Botnets, where a central bot controls all the others. It has **several protection mechanisms**, to prevent unauthorized access, including a very interesting **dropper**. We were able to get a dump of the machine that rafael\_p uses for his tests. Your **goal** is to be able to extract the bot to try to understand its operation, connect to the network and bypass all its protections to pwn the instance of this bot that is running, to got access to its channel on C2. With that, we will get to know all the other administrators who are also involved in this project. This information will be very useful in the future.

**Flag format:** CTF-BR{admin1,admin2,admin3...} (nicknames in ascending alphabetical order)
